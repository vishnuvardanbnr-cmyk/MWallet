## Development
```bash
npm run dev        # Start dev server (port 5000)
npm run db:push    # Push schema changes to database
npm run build      # Build for production
```

## Deploying to VPS
```bash
# SSH into VPS
sshpass -p "$VPS_SSH_PASSWORD" ssh root@173.249.10.179

# On VPS: pull changes, rebuild, restart
cd /opt/mvault
git pull
npm run build
pm2 restart mvault
```

## Known Issues / Notes
- The `.env` file on the VPS was being served publicly via `/api/.env` — this is a security vulnerability that should be blocked in nginx
- BoardMatrixHandler contract changes (virtualRewardBalance, claimAndSwapToBTC, 9-member boards) are NOT yet deployed to the blockchain
- The BTC Updater PM2 process has a placeholder private key and is not running
